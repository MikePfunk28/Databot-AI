- **Test**: Successfully uploaded CSV file `test_data.csv`
- **Dataset ID**: `test_data_csv_fec9f325_20250524000441`

### 2. URL Feature ✅ WORKING  
- **Issue**: URL ingestion endpoint missing method
- **Root Cause**: `ingest_url` method was not implemented in DataIngestion class

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. Test chat with uploaded datasets (RAG functionality)
2. Test dataset management features (activate/deactivate)
3. Improve model response quality and system prompt
4. Add error handling for edge cases
5. Test frontend JavaScript integration
